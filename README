Speech::Recognition::Vosk - offline voice recognition using the Vosk toolkit



INSTALLATION

This is a Perl module distribution. It should be installed with whichever
tool you use to manage your installation of Perl, e.g. any of

  cpanm .
  cpan  .
  cpanp -i .

The Makefile.PL will download and compile the prerequisite C parts. If
the automatic build fails, you'll have to run the shell
script C<build-vosk-api.sh> yourself.

The build file expects the following programs to be available:

    cmake
    autoconf
    git
    bash

Consult https://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html for further instruction.
Should you wish to install this module manually, the procedure is

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install
